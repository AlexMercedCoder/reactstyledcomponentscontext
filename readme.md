# Styled Components ROUTER CONTEXT TEMPLATE

#### Created by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com/devNursery.com

This react template uses webpack as a bundler and...

- Has router configured
- Pre-Made Header and Footer Components
- GlobalContext for managing App level state (just import GlobalContext from App and the useContext hook to access the global state)
- Styled-Components is configured for styling, just export styles from components/styles.js

Make sure to remove the git repository

`sudo rm -r .git` from the root folder

Otherwise...

`npm run dev` to run dev server
`npm run build` to build into build folder
